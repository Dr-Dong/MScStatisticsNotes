MScStatisticsNotes
==================

These are cheat sheets and notes I made as part of an MSc in Statistics, at the University of Sheffield, UK.

*Year 1*
1. LinearModels.{tex,pdf}
2. GeneralizedLinearModels.{Rnw,pdf}
3. LinearMixedModels.{Rnw,pdf}

*Year 2*
1. BayesianDataAnalysis.{Rnw,pdf}
2. ComputationaInference.{Rnw,pdf}

These come with some data files that are in the data directory. For convenience, I provide the pdf files as well, but please
note that they will only display using preview in Mac OS X, Adobe Acrobat returns an error. You can recompile the .Rnw files
on your system to make them work for you.
