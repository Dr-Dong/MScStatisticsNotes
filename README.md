http://maths.dept.shef.ac.uk/maths/module_info_1150.html

1. MultivariateAnalysisSummary.{Rnw,pdf}
2. MedicalStatisticsSummary.{Rnw,pdf}

*Miscellaneous Notes*

1. NumericalMethods.{Rnw}  This has just been started, nowhere near complete.
2. Exampleslinmod.{Rnw} Also incomplete, but examples of interesting cases.

*Data files and pdfs*

These come with some data files that are in the data directory, and some pdf figures. For convenience, I provide the pdf files as well, but please note that they will only display using preview in Mac OS X, Adobe Acrobat returns an error. You can recompile the .Rnw files on your system to make them work for you. Alternatively, in the directory I have Adobe-readable files of all the summary sheets.
